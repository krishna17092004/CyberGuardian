Use a Neo-Brutalism style with bold colors, high contrast, thick black borders (3-4px), and harsh drop shadows. Create an intentionally "undesigned" aesthetic with raw typography and slightly asymmetrical layouts. Buttons should have thick borders and strong color contrast. Avoid gradients and subtle shadows in favor of stark, bold design elements.
